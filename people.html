                            Professor Raviraj Nataraj, Ph.D., is investigating innovative rehabilitation solutions to improve function following injury or neuromuscular disease. His current research interests include simulation-based development of
                            exoskeleton controllers for gait, optimizing rehabilitation of hand function following stroke, and developing novel training paradigms to minimize musculoskeletal injury. He has previously performed clinical research
                            involving restoration of standing following spinal cord injury at the Louis Stokes VAMC and investigation of hand sensorimotor control at the Cleveland Clinic. He has received postgraduate degrees in Mechanical and
                            Biomedical Engineering from Stanford University and Case Western Reserve University.
